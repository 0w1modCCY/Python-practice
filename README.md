# Python-practice

This is just a collection of all the different Python files I have been doing during the last year by myself.
My main goal was to learn this famous programming language that everybody is talking about, and I discovered that you can do a lot of things with just 20 lines of code.
I wish this language was part of any University subjects like Artificial Intelligence , but it isn't right now.
